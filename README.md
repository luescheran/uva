# UVa Online Judge Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for UVa Online Judge
problems, mostly C++ along with reference input, output, helper
scripts and (limited) library code.

Some problems include a 
[notes.md](solutions/10187-FromDuskTillDawn/notes.md) file (of varying
quality) describing details of the approach taken, particularly tricky
corner/edge cases and optimisations.
