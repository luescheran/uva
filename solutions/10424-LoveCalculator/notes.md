This is an input parsing/understanding problem

The input specification is poor and there are edge cases which are not defined.

The case where either score is 0 should be 100%.

Ignore the stuff in the forums about outputting a blank line, this is
unnecessary.

input4.txt shows critical input e.g. @@ and 123 should be 100%
