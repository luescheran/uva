Josephus (variant).

This problem does not make sense to me.

The problem description does not match the sample output.

Here is what the problem says:

1) Every day all dole applicants will be placed in a large circle, facing inwards.

OK fine.

2) Someone is arbitrarily chosen as number 1

OK fine.

3) and the rest are numbered counter-clockwise up to N

Now it gets fun. So we have:

    1
  2  10
 3     9
 4     8
  5   7
    6

If you flatten this into an array, you get:

1 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

4) up to N (who will be standing on 1's left)

Disagree - N is on 1's right and 2 is on 1's left.

So what I missing?
